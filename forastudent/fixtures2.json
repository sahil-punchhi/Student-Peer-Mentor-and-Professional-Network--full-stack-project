Envisioned IoT applications in healthcare, well-being, entertainment, structural monitoring and other domains will require integrated systems that incorporate all different combinations of sensing, acquisition, and processing modules each manufactured in the most suitable process node. An enabling technology for supporting these systems is three-dimensional integration where multiple physical tiers are integrated to form a multi-tier stack. integrated circuits typically use through silicon vias (TSV) for electrical inter-tier connectivity. These solutions, however, are still very expensive and technologically challenging, especially for heterogeneous designs where TSVs between tiers fabricated in different process nodes are required. Wireless connectivity through magnetic field, on the other hand, can circumvent these limitations providing cost-efficient solutions for inter-tier communication and sufficient power delivery. Designing these wireless inductive links is a challenging approach, due to strict area and power constraints, therefore awaiting new ideas that will result in efficient power transfer techniques and reliable data exchange schemes. This research project aims specifically the topic of power transfer between tiers for sensor driven applications. The design space for these power transfer components is multi-dimensional depending upon the power transfer method, e.g., inductive coupling or magnetic resonance, area, power demand, physical distance between the tiers, sensor EM sensitivity, etc. This complex design space presents unique opportunities for novel circuit design techniques and optimization methodologies for a diversity of objectives such as system performance, cost/area, noise, and inter-tier bandwidth. Tradeoffs among physical parameters for the on-chip inductors and different circuit designs should be explored leading potentially to several link designs with different traits, offering greater insight in the design of highly heterogeneous contactless vertical systems. This project will build on existing expertise recently developed in the group in the design of inter-tier communication links. Test circuits to measure the efficiency of the proposed ideas will be fabricated through multi-project wafer services and the student will also have the opportunity to gain experience in testing of ICs in addition to design and simulation methods.", "start_date": "2020-09-22", "duration": "10 weeks", "skills": [182, 289, 135, 112, 54]}},

For centuries, we have used a wide range of technologies, techniques and artefacts to augment our natural capacity for memory ??? storytelling and heirlooms have helped us share knowledge and experiences from generation to generation, written language allows us to produce to-do lists and records of our activities, and photographs help us remember how people and objects appeared in the past. Innovation in digital multimedia has transformed the artefacts that we collect about both our everyday experiences and special occasions. For example, family photograph albums containing generations of carefully posed birth and wedding have been replaced with large-scale uncurated collections of digital photographs captured in an adhoc fashion on smartphones and other devices. Whilst concerns have been raised about digital preservation (i.e. how do we ensure that these new digital artefacts aren???t lost or destroyed), there has been limited research effort centred on the changes that new multimedia artefacts are having on our capacity to remember. This PhD would look to address the gap in current research with regard to the role of digital multimedia on human memory. The project would develop our understanding of how technology may already be changing the way that we remember and look to establish new approaches to prevent technology-driven human memory degradation.", "start_date": "2020-09-23", "duration": "15 weeks", "skills": [182, 104, 368, 104, 108]}},

Configuring, using and maintaining these tools can be very costly for an organisation. Analytics tools require expertise from a range of specialties, including business insight, state-of-the-art modelling approaches and tools such as AI and machine learning as well as efficient data management practices. A knowledge engineering approach can deliver flexible and custom data analytics applications that align with organisational objectives and existing IT infrastructures. This model uses existing resources and knowledge within the organisation. The project uses semantic-web based knowledge modelling techniques to build a comprehensive view related to an organisation’s analytics objectives while leveraging open knowledge and open data to expand its scope and reduce costs. We aim to help organisations utilise and reuse public and organizational knowledge efficiently when conducting data analytics. Our work also involves the rapid development and deployment of analytics applications that suit emerging analytics needs, plugging new data and software on-demand using new approaches such as APIs and cloud services. The proposed techniques have already been piloted in the areas of house price prediction in collaboration with the NSW Government and portfolio management in collaboration with Ignition Wealth.", "start_date": "2020-09-26", "duration": "6 weeks", "skills": [36, 289, 104, 3, 86]}},

At present there are significant concerns regarding uneven and inadequate use of diabetes technology by eligible patients, as demonstrated by the marked and systematic gap between the number of UK patients who are eligible for insulin pump usage and the number who currently use pumps.1 Since the significant clinical benefits of cutting-edge closed-loop artificial pancreas systems will only be realised at scale if such systems are used by a wider range of UK patients than currently use insulin pumps, it is imperative to evaluate and understand the full range of barriers and opportunities to new technology usage. Clinician attitudes play a significant role in enabling and/or hindering appropriate access to, and sustained usage of, new diabetes technologies. As yet, however, little is known about clinician attitudes or the varying influences upon such attitudes in clinics serving different populations. This study will address this gap by exploring clinician attitudes towards new diabetes technologies in four clinics serving important sub-sets of the type 1 diabetes population (pregnant women and newly-diagnosed children) with two contemporary diabetes technologies CGM, artificial pancreas in the context of two current studies with elements of JDRF funding CONCEPT and newly-diagnosed closed-loop study.

The mass data produced in this last century offers potentially a rich source of information that allows the auditors to have a deeper understanding of business risks, financial performance and potential fraud opportunities. The aim of this research is to explore how auditors carry out their audit engagements in this data-driven era and to identify new areas of services auditors provide to their clients in the process of managing Big Data.There are both opportunities and challenges for companies from Big Data, as this creates the need for new skills, tools and ways of thinking. So what does the data-driven era imply for accountancy professionals? According to Alles (2015), studying the challenges faced by the external auditors is important as they provide independent financial statement audits, key to the stability of the financial markets. Given the fact that the main driver of Big Data application is client-side demands, in the past, auditors have not always been ready to respond to such industry led challenges.
